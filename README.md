# poetry-maker


Download it through NPM using 



## What is it?
Poetry Maker is a project I am working on that generates poems from random words taken from either websites or text files.
It also happens to be my submission for a class project (class will be disclosed later for protection against people taking my code to use for their own project)

## What are some features of this program?
It runs a command line interface that allows users to create poems from websites or pre-made text files
It also allows users to create their own custom text files for use in poems, and also allows users to browse past poems that they have saved.

## How do I install it and use it?
The full version can be installed through npm by typing
```
npm install poetry-maker
```
To run it, you have to first move the folder containing the files to an easy-to-find place. Then you have to go to your terminal application and use the command:
```
cd [Directory containing file]
```
then run the program by typing:
```
node poetry-maker.js
```
